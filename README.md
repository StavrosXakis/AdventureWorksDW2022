# AdventureWorksDW2022

This project leverages the AdventureWorksDW2022 database to perform an Internet Sales Analysis, showcasing a robust Data Analytics and Business Intelligence portfolio. My goal was to demonstrate an end-to-end (E2E) solution process for tackling a stakeholder's business request.

AdventureWorksDW2022 contains fictional data designed to mimic real-world business scenarios. It represents AdventureWorks, a hypothetical bicycle manufacturing company that sells products through various channels, including internet sales and resellers.

The attached presentation takes you through a detailed data story, highlighting critical steps such as:

1. Understanding the business request.
2. Breaking it down into actionable items.
3. Applying database management skills with SQL to extract the necessary information.
4. Creating a data model by combining different sources in Power BI.
5. Bringing the data to life with insightful Power BI dashboards that meet stakeholder criteria effectively.

This project was not just about playing with data (although thatâ€™s always fun ðŸ˜„). It was about solving real-world challenges, enhancing decision-making processes, and delivering value through data-driven insights.
